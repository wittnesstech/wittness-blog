# Wittness Tech
 Wittness was born when two brothers of a suburban town of Pakistan recognised their interest in computers. Their thirst for knowledge and curiosity made them tech engineers and problem solvers.
Gaining fulfillment by extending help, they set out to help surrounding individuals and organisations.
Today Wittness is proudly helping organisations in forming the technical stack tailored for their unique business needs.

## Our Mission
**Technology** deployed with compassion is invigorating for every outfit. It pleases us at Wittness when our elaborately created solutions fill the unknown void for any business, and make our clients go "Wow". 

## System Consultants
